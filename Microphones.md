# Microphones

## Information

There are two main types of microphone: dynamic mics and condenser mics. Some of the key differences are listed below.
* **Phantom Power** Phantom power is a 48V supply of power which an audio interface, mic preamp, or mixing console supplies to the microphone via an XLR cable. This can usually be activated or deactivated using a switch or button on the audio interface or mixing console. Condenser mics require phantom power in order to work, whereas dynamic mics do not require phantom power. A dynamic mic will still work, even if phantom power is turned on – the phantom power will not damage the microphone.

* **Pickup Pattern** Condenser mics are better at picking up small details as well as sounds that are being produced far away from the microphone. This is why condenser mics are typically used as boom mics to record the voices of actors in films. The mic doesn't have to be super close to the actor, and only has to point vaguely in their direction. Consequently, condenser mics are great for recording acoustic instruments, such as pianos or guitars. They are also suitable for vocal performances with lots of dynamics, or where picking up fine details in the voice is important. Dynamic mics, on the other hand, only pick up sound that is directly in front of the mic and close to the mic. This makes them suitable for recording vocals on-stage, in an untreated room with an air-conditioner or near a busy road, or any situation where there is lots of background noise.

* **Proximity Effect** The proximity effect is a bass-boosting effect that occurs when the sound source (e.g. the singer's mouth) is positioned very close (a few inches) to the microphone. The proximity effect occurs in both types of microphone, but is more noticible in dynamic mics. There are situations where proximity effect is undesireable, such as when recording a singer with a very deep voice, but there are also situations where it is desireable, such as recording fry screams (which sometimes lack the low-end power  that is generally associated with screams).

* **Distance Effect** Moving further away from the microphone produces different effects depending on the type of microphone. Dynamic mics struggle to pick up sound that is produced far away from them. Stepping a few feet back from a dynamic mic will cause you voice to become very quiet in the recording. Since Condenser mics pick up more details, they will still pick up your voice when you stand a few feet back from the microphone. In the recording, your voice will sound more distant, but will still be clearly audible. This can be very useful for recording backing vocals.

* **Handling Noise** Condenser mics pick up more handling noise, which means they must be used on a stand, and the vocalist must not touch the mic or the stand during recording. Using a mic stand is recommended regarless of the microphone type, but you can usually get away with recording a dynamic handheld, should you need to.

In addition to condenser and dynamic microphones, there are also ribbon microphones, but these are very delicate and probably shouldn't be handled by beginners.

## Purchasing Advice

Microphones convert vibration in the air into an analog electrical signal using magnets and coiled wires, much like electric guitar pickups or like a loudspeaker but with the process done in reverse. The important piece of information here is that the microphone outputs an analog signal. Computers, on the other hand, only know how to process digital signals. This means that you will need to purchase some form of analog-to-digital (AD) converter if you want to record from your microphone into a computer. Musicians typically make use of an audio interface (which contains AD converters) in order to do this. Some microphones have a built-in AD converter and can be connected to a computer via a USB cable, but this is not the norm. 

There are many YouTube videos available which provide audio demos for mics and compare them. [Audiohaze](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIKeAXPgXUDuKgfT5SZogpF31SoHYEYwW&si=fUydDbl2PkTgro7c) has some great videos which compare popular cheap and budget-friendly (and sometimes expensive) microphones.

Microphones can be purchased used at a lower price than new, but do note that microphones can degrade in sound quality over time – especially cheap ones.
